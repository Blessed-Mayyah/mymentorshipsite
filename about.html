    <h1>WHAT WE DO</h1>
    <p>
      SBH provides Christ-like love to babies and children deprived of parental
      love. Sanyu Babies’ Home is a Christian organisation based in Kampala,
      Uganda that seeks to provide Christ-like love to babies and children
      deprived of parental love and to reintegrate them into the community
      through reuniting them with their families, fostering or adoption.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sanyu Babies’ Home is the first and oldest Babies’ Home in Uganda. Sanyu
      was founded in 1929 by Milnes Winfred Walker, a British midwife working as
      a missionary at Mengo Hospital. Milnes Winfred Walker noticed the large
      number of babies being abandoned at the hospital after their birth and
      took them into her care. Today, we continue to do this work. Child
      abandonment is still an issue; many of our children are found abandoned in
      ditches, at hospitals, in taxi parks, on garbage heaps, at the side of the
      road or in pit latrines. The children are taken to the police who refer
      the child into our custody for love, care and attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here at Sanyu we have the capacity to care for up to 50 children at a
      time, although during our busiest time we often operate at over capacity!
      The children in our care typically are between the ages of 0-4yrs.
      Sometimes we may care for a child until they are a little older if it
      gives them the chance to be reunited or adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Sanyu’ means joy and that is what we want our children, staff members and
      volunteers to experience while they are with us. We want our children to
      know that they are deeply loved, have an extended family who care about
      them and know that they will always have a place to call home.
